/// - Filtering out unnecessary weights (e.g., position_ids)
/// - Transposing weight tensors for specific layers
/// - Validating and processing weight shapes
///
/// The class processes weights for different model components:
/// - BERT encoder weights
/// - Predictor (duration and prosody) weights
/// - Text encoder weights
/// - Decoder weights

  /// - **Predictor weights**: Transposes F0 and N projection weights, handles weight_v conditionally
  /// - **Text encoder weights**: Handles weight_v with conditional transposition
  /// - **Decoder weights**: Transposes noise convolution weights and handles weight_v conditionally
  /// - Parameter modelPath: URL to the directory containing model weight files
  /// - Returns: Dictionary mapping weight names to their processed MLXArray tensors
  /// - Throws: The underlying safetensors parsing or file-system error.
